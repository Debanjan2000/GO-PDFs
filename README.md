# GO-PDFs
From 2021 onwards all [PDFs](http://book.gateoverflow.in) of [GATE Overflow](https://gateoverflow.in) will be released here. We are planning the following PDFs.
1. GATE Overflow for GATE CSE 2022, 3 volumes (Released)
2. TIFR CSE PDF (Draft Released)
3. GATE Overflow for UGC NET CSE
4. GATE Overflow for ISRO CSE
5. GATE Overflow for NIELIT Scientist A,B,C,D CSE
6. Aptitude Overflow

GATE Overflow PDFs are made from the contents of [GATE Overflow](https://gateoverflow.in) site which runs on [Q2A](https://www.question2answer.org/qa/) software. For making the PDFs from HTML we make use of the Open Source tool [wkhtmltopdf](https://wkhtmltopdf.org/). We also rely on this [wonderful plugin](https://github.com/GATEOverflow/q2a-book) from Noah to convert Q2A content to PDF.

# GO-PDFs
From 2021 onwards all [PDFs](http://book.gateoverflow.in) of [GATE Overflow](https://gateoverflow.in) will be released here. We are planning the following PDFs.
1. GATE Overflow for GATE CSE 2022, 3 volumes
2. GATE Overflow for UGC NET CSE
3. GATE Overflow for ISRO CSE
4. GATE Overflow for NIELIT Scientist A,B,C,D CSE
5. Aptitude Overflow

GATE Overflow PDFs are made from the contents of [GATE Overflow](https://gateoverflow.in) site which runs on [Q2A](https://www.question2answer.org/qa/) software. For making the PDFs from HTML we make use of the Open Source tool [wkhtmltopdf](https://wkhtmltopdf.org/).

Please consider [donating](https://pmny.in/3IXN3eO4LhXi) to this project as it can help us in making more PDFs for free usage. Total donations received will be updated here by beginning of every month starting July 2021.
